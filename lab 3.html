        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology B.S</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a third-year biology major at the University of California, Riverside, my journey toward a career in medicine has been shaped by both academic curiosity and hands-on experiences that have deepened my commitment to patient care. I’ve always known that I wanted to work in a field where I could help others directly, and over the past few years, that passion has only grown stronger. Now, as a pre-med student with plans to graduate in Spring 2026, I’m excited to pursue a future in medicine, most likely specializing in either pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology.
<br><br>

        My interest in these fields stems from a desire to form long-term, supportive relationships with patients and to be a part of some of the most personal and transformative moments in their lives. Whether it's guiding children through their early years or supporting women through pregnancy and reproductive health, both specialties speak to my passion for connection, care, and advocacy.
<br><br>

        To explore the realities of healthcare beyond the classroom, I began volunteering at Kaiser Permanente. Being in that environment allowed me to observe the rhythm of clinical work and gain exposure to the real-world challenges and rewards of patient care. I saw how much collaboration and empathy go into every interaction, and those experiences helped me appreciate the human side of medicine even more. On campus, I’ve been fortunate to be part of a muscle physiology research lab, where I’ve been able to explore the science behind how the body functions and responds to stress. Research has added a different dimension to my education, it’s taught me patience, critical thinking, and the importance of approaching problems from multiple angles. It’s also shown me how closely medicine and science are intertwined, and how important it is for physicians to keep asking questions and staying informed.
<br><br>
        Academically, I’ve completed all of my lower-division coursework and am currently wrapping up my upper-division classes. Balancing school, volunteering, and research hasn’t always been easy, but it’s helped me grow in resilience and time management—skills I know I’ll rely on in medical school and beyond.
Looking ahead, I’m more committed than ever to a career in medicine. The experiences I’ve had so far have not only confirmed that I’m on the right path but have also helped me grow into someone who is ready to meet the challenges of this field with empathy, determination, and a deep sense of purpose.
